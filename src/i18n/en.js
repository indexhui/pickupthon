    'The Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), established by the United Nations in 2015, aim to address 17 critical issues, including poverty, hunger, education, health, and climate change. The SDGs underscore the significance of sustainable development and encourage collaboration among countries worldwide to progress along the path of sustainability.',

    'However, achieving these goals necessitates collective engagement and innovative thinking from individuals across various sectors. In recent years, with the escalation of extreme global climates, an increasing number of individuals and organizations have raised awareness about sustainable development issues. They are beginning to recognize the importance of sustainable development for our living environment. Traditional business models and design approaches have proven inadequate in confronting sustainability challenges. Thus, a more innovative approach is required to tackle these issues. In this context, the Pickupthon International Sustainable Design Hackathon was born!',
